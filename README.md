# Embedded home automation client

Android implementation of home automation client.

Client recommended api level is 15. Does not include the server that is designed for the client, so it wont connect anywhere automatically. The project IP-addresses are currently hardcoded to connect localhost for testing purposes. 
The server is not available at the moment as it is not done by me.
